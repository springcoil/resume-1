I'm a curious, business-outcomes focused Data Scientist/Engineer. 
I'm especially excited about delivering 
product and fascinated about solving what I term the 'last mile' problem
of Data Science.

Selected Projects and Outcomes
==============================

**Machine Learning and Data Products** (London 2012 onwards)
During an internship at Import.io in the summer of 2012 I began to discover 'data science'.
Since then my career has been business-impact focused and I've worked on many general types of problem.
While I'm strictly a generalist, I'm happy diving into problems with command-line tools such as *sed* and *awk*,
I'm obsessed with *Bayesian Statistics* and contribute to *PyMC3* 

-   **PyMC3: https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3** Internet.
    Late 2014-Present. PyMC3 is a Probabilistic Programming framework written in Python. 
    Uses Theano as a backend, supports NUTS and ADVI. I've been involved in writing documentation, tests
    and some of the model evaluation tools for model selection. This has taught me a lot about delivering 
    good software. 

-   **Machine Learning applications in Industry** Various Employers 
    2013-now. I self taught myself Python, R and some Scala and I've successfully applied Machine Learning models
    such as Random Forests for scoring customers for acquisition purposes at JobToday, predicting flight delays as 
    a freelance consultant (at A-Syst SA) in Luxembourg, predicting which trucks would be delayed at Amazon, 
    and targeted advertising at Channel 4. I've succcessfully deployed models via emailed reports, microservices, 
    dashboards and even the occasional powerpoint presentation! I believe that the model is a small part of data
    science and have learned that simple (such as linear regression or logistic regression) is often the best. 


**Timeseries and Forecasting problems** (Luxembourg, London 2012 - onwards) 
I've been fascinated by applying both Bayesian and Frequentist methods to solving challenges related to predicting the future.
This has included a lot of time series analysis for various reasons. Specifically I've contributed to the following projects.

- **Forecasting in Media** Channel 4. The broadcasting and video-on-demand industry have a lot of advertising,
and scheduling related challenges. I worked on Greenfield R and D projects related to this area, leveraging my expertise
in Time series analysis and Bayesian Statistics. 
-  **Energy Market Analysis** Vodafone 2014. Working closely with the risk, treasury and procurement departments
I built a number of tools for market-intelligence based on Energy Market data (from third parties and internal)
this was used for reasons of cost control. 
-  **Forecasting Energy Consumption** Vodafone 2014. I worked on a number of proof of concepts to enhance understanding of 
Energy consumption - which is a huge cost for telecommunications companies in their buildings and base-stations. This was 
for both corporate social responsibility and for cost reasons.  
- **Statistical Learning Theory applied to Time-Series Forecasting** University of Luxembourg 2012 - 2014. 
I've worked on a number of research projects which began in Stochastic Calculus, but eventually evolved towards model-selection. 
My thesis was finally on Concentration of Measure applied to the problem of time-series forecasting for model evaluation of
econometric models used in forecasting. I specifically looked at the problem of predicting unemployment based on data from the 
Federal Reserve. 

**Data Pipelines and Data Engineering** (Luxembourg, Brussels, London 2013 - onwards)
Since I've often not had a lot of technical support in my roles, I've had to learn a lot about Software
Development. I've attended numerous meetups to improve my 'craft' as an Engineer. I've had to build 
email reporting systems on schedulers, deploy machine learning models via microservices, learn how to use
Luigi and other tools to deploy and schedule data acquisitions. I strongly believe in good code,
and I've written and given talks on these topics. 


Community Engagement
====================

A large part of my work involves engaging with and sometimes building
the communities around the disciplines I work within.

-   <span>**Data Science Meetup** </span> 2013 - 2016
    I helped run the Data Science Meetup in Luxembourg which included inviting speakers
    such as Thomas Wiecki from Quantopian (PyMC3 contributor). I helped grow this to about 50 
    regular members. 

-   <span>**talks: PyCon and PyData**</span> 2015 - onwards. 
    I've given numerous talks about PyMC3, Data Products, the PyData Stack.
    You can see a list of talks here.
